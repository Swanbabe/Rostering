    "### _Intern Rotation Duration Constraint_\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the major point at which our current model falls apart.  We require interns to spend a period of time in each rotation in **consecutive** blocks.  Mathematically, the below system works, however it becomes flawed when trying to use it in CPLEX. This was an issue for two reasons:\n",
    "1. The inability to input decision variables into \"if\" statements\n",
    "    - This is something we have attemted to rectify with 'Big M' If/Then constraints.  This is currently still a work in progress, however we believe we have some issue with dependency of the variables - it would seem that the variables being dependent undermines the ability of If/Then to work correctly.\n",
    "2. Our initial use of the $k$ values as strings. To combat the 2. issue, we attempted to change $k$ to an integer value, however this resulted in its inability to be used in the same fashion in $x_{jk}^i$. \n",
    "    - This has been resolved.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are currently re-evaluating our options.  One that was explored was that we might just ascribe weights to each Rotation (this being the duration), and use a binary variable instead of $x_{ij}$.  However this limits us in the particular regard that we would not be able to specify specific weeks for availability - an aspect of flexibility integral as we refine the model.  There are to be a number of final constraints still to be added which depend on the model having this quality.\n",
